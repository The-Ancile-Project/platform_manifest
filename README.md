packages_apps_dialer

    There was a phone icon located on call_log after making a call that was always tinted and has always frustrated us themers due to us not being able to make it a solid color.. So I exposed it by deleting the “0.3” tint to enable us to theme with a solid color or tint like we use to with just the color in res/values/colors.xml
